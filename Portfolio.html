        <h1>Edmund Kiragu</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Edmund and I just started <strong>coding</strong> last week and I <em>love</em> it.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>First things first, I am profoundedly surprised to be  sreiously talented in these:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Art</strong>(<em>I just love drawing and calligraphy</em>)</li>
                <li><strong>Soccer</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Swimming</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Playing the piano</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Photography</strong></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>I also love coming up with cool science projects with friends.</br>I just added coding to my list of the things I love. I've always wanted to know how <em>websites</em> are created and I am happy to see that I can create one on my own.</p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>Here are a few coding projects I have worked on during my learning experience. </br>I think of them as <i>experimental websites</i> where I tryout something new I learn.</p>
